</p><p>THIS AGREEMENT
</p><p>PART A [Terms of Service] of this Researcher Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (this "Agreement") governs your use of the Website and Services as made available to you by CIO.
</p><p>PART B [Privacy Policy] of this Agreement discloses the ways we process your personal information, the purposes of processing and your Privacy rights.

</p><p>2 Limited License to use the Researcher Survey Data Researcher grants to CIO a perpetual, worldwide, non-revocable, non-exclusive license to access and use the "Researcher Survey Data" solely for the following purposes and under the following limitations:
</p><p>(i) CIO may access, store and process the Researcher Survey Data, in order to be able to monitor the Survey Process and provide its services to Researcher. CIO may also access, store and process the Researcher Survey Data for purposes of prevention and detection
</p><p>(ii) CIO may access and process the Researcher Survey Data for purposes of inferring general statistical and market preference information connected to a Survey Respondent profile (" Derived General Tagging Data"), with the sole aim of enhancing CIO's audience targeting capabilities. Any general statistical and market-preference insights derived by CIO through the process described above, shall be completely dissociated from the specific Survey as created and conducted by Researcher. For example, if the Survey Respondent answers a question about a sports product, CIO may tag such Respondent as a "sports fan" and include such data in its Database in order to improve its general audience targeting capabilities, but will not use , exploit or further process the specific answer of the Survey Respondent as related to a specific product, brand or entity or as related to a specific question which has been included in the Survey questionnaire; Researcher grants CIO a perpetual, worldwide, non-revocable, non-exclusive license to use, adapt, make available, create derivatives and exploit the "Derived General Tagging Data", solely for improvement of the Service's targeting capabilities and only in their form as CIO-processed general tagging data fully dissociated from the specific Researcher Survey questionnaires.
</p><p>(iii) In no case (including cases under (i) or (ii) above) shall CIO share, disclose, divulge or make available the Researcher Survey Data to third parties, except if requested to do so pursuant to a court order, subpoena, or other governmental authority.
</p><p>2.1 Ownership and Licensing of Existing CIO Database Data.

CIO grants Researcher a perpetual, worldwide, non-revocable, non-exclusive license to access, use, modify, copy, distribute, create derivatives, display, perform and adapt the "Existing CIO-Database Data" for marketing purposes and subject to the terms and limitations set herein, including limitations set-out in Appendix A of this Agreement.
</p><p>3. PERSONAL DATA SECURITY AND LAWFUL PROCESSING
</p><p>3.1 Definitions. As used in this Section 3 of PART A of this Agreement, (a) "Personal Data" shall mean any data falling within the definition of "personal data" under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR"). (b) "Researcher Personal Data" shall mean any Personal Data, not previously existing in CIO Databases which is provided to CIO by the Researcher and is processed by CIO, on behalf of the Researcher. (c) "Personal Data Deliverables" shall mean any portion of Reporting Deliverables delivered/licensed to Researcher under this Agreement, which may consist of Personal Data, including the "Existing CIO Database Data". 
</p><p>3.2 CIO shall be deemed Controller of the Existing CIO Database Data for all processing operations pertaining to the use and exploitation of such Data by CIO, including the collection, storage and processing of such Data.
</p><p>3.3 For clarity, each Party will be deemed a separate Controller of the Data it processes under its capacity as Controller and the parties are not joint controllers in respect of the aforementioned processing operations.
</p><p>3.4 If and to the extent that the provision of any services set forth in this Agreement may be deemed to include processing of Personal Data on behalf of the Researcher by CIO.


</p><p>3 Use of Confidential Information. 
</p><p>The Confidential Information will be kept strictly confidential and shall not, without prior written consent, be, whether orally or in writing or by any other means, disclosed, divulged, provided or made accessible to any other person (the term "person/s" as used in this Agreement being broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership and individual as well), either directly or indirectly by the Receiving party or by its agents, representatives, officers, directors, partners, employees or advisors (including, without limitation, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors), in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and shall not be used by the Receiving party or its Representatives, for any purpose whatsoever other than for the performance of this Agreement (the "Purpose"). The Receiving party shall disclose the Confidential Information only to such of its directors, employees or representatives as they may need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose. The Receiving party shall treat the Confidential Information with the same degree of care and with sufficient protection from unauthorized disclosure as the Receiving Party uses to maintain its own confidential or proprietary information. The Receiving party shall ensure that anyone to whom the Receiving party discloses the information complies with this Agreement as if they were the Receiving Party and that they enter into a Confidentiality Agreement with the Receiving party (or directly with the Disclosing party, if the latter so requests) on terms no less protective than those contained in this Agreement. Every party and its Representatives will take all necessary organizational and technical measures to ensure that all Confidential Information is properly safeguarded. In the event that the Receiving Party is required by law, Public Authorities or court order to disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, it shall use its best endeavors: (i) To inform the Disclosing Party of the full circumstances of the disclosure and the Confidential Information to be disclosed (ii) To consult with the Disclosing Party with the aim of taking all possible steps to avoid or limit disclosure and taking those steps where they would not result in significant adverse consequences to the Disclosing Party (iii) To gain assurances in relation to confidentiality from the body to whom the information shall be disclosed (iv) To limit the disclosure and provide only the absolutely necessary Confidential Information as requested by the Competent Authorities, provided, however that any such disclosed information will remain subject to this Confidentiality Agreement.

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
The past, present and future content of the Properties, including without limitation, copyright works and all intellectual property rights (including Industrial Property rights) such as software, logos, trademarks domain names, designs, graphics, pictures, photos, texts, newsletters, etc and any and all copyright material and all other intellectual property right and/or materials related to the Properties (collectively "Content") are the sole property of CIO. Except as stated herein, no rights in or to the Content and/or to the Properties are granted to you.
5. PRESERVING CONFIDENTIALITY OF SURVEYS
CIO understands that surveys distributed may include sensitive or confidential information about the Researcher's business and operations (e.g. launching of a new product, marketing strategies etc as such information may be revealed directly or indirectly through the contents of a certain survey), which the Researcher does not want to be made public or become accessible to competitors. CIO cannot guarantee that the Respondents will treat such information as confidential and that they will desist from divulging or reproducing it. Therefore, in case your survey contains confidential information you wish to protect, we advise you to draft your surveys accordingly. Here are some indicative steps you could follow, in order to reduce aforementioned risks:
(a) You could consider not using any mark, name, logo or other sign which may identify your Company,
(b) You could use an alternate-test name for the product related to your survey.
Please note that experience has proven that "confidentiality notifications" presented to the Respondent at the end of surveys usually has the opposite effect than the one expected, since Respondents seem to share information flagged as "confidential", more often than they do with information which is not directly identifiable as confidential or sensitive.
